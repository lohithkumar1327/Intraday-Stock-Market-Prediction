# Intraday-Stock-Market-Prediction
Intraday stock market prediction using LSTM and Sentiment Analysis 
Intraday stock market prediction stands as a formidable challenge in the field of
financial data science and artificial intelligence, bearing crucial significance across domains
such as algorithmic trading, high-frequency financial analytics, investment decision support
systems, and economic forecasting. The objective of this task is to predict short-term stock
price movements—typically at minute-level resolution—by modeling complex, nonlinear
market behaviors that are influenced by a confluence of factors such as historical pricing
trends, trading volume, and rapidly evolving public sentiment. Achieving accurate intraday
forecasts demands a sophisticated integration of temporal pattern recognition and contextual
market interpretation, wherein both numerical time-series data and unstructured textual
signals must be leveraged to uncover latent drivers of price volatility.
